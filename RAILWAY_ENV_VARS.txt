# Railway Environment Variables - COPY THESE EXACTLY

Set these in Railway Dashboard → Your Project → Variables:

```
APP_NAME=Pi Remote Light
APP_ENV=production
APP_KEY=base64:EnPxedJVAHAXM/Wp3GaborUdy5N7nylq7sh66w3G4nw=
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://your-domain.up.railway.app

SESSION_DRIVER=database
SESSION_LIFETIME=120
SESSION_ENCRYPT=false
BROADCAST_CONNECTION=log
FILESYSTEM_DISK=local
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
CACHE_STORE=database
```

## Critical Variables (MUST SET):
1. **APP_KEY** - Use the one above or generate new: `php artisan key:generate --show`
2. **APP_URL** - Get from Railway after generating domain (Settings → Networking → Generate Domain)
3. **APP_ENV** - MUST be `production`
4. **APP_DEBUG** - MUST be `false` for production

## After Setting Variables:
1. Save all variables in Railway
2. Railway will automatically redeploy
3. Check logs: Deployments → View Logs
4. Look for "Setting up Laravel for Railway..." message

## If Still Getting 500 Error:
Check Railway logs for these common errors:
- "Please provide a valid app key" → APP_KEY not set correctly
- "Permission denied" → Storage permissions issue (should be fixed by start.sh)
- "Database file not found" → Should be created by start.sh, check logs
- "Class not found" → Composer packages issue, check build logs
